					Last Valentine’s Day, President Benigno S.
					Aquino III emphasized the government’s efforts
					to develop the Philippines as one of the world’s
					top travel and tourism destinations. P-Noy, as
					the President is fondly called, was speaking
					before the members, delegates and participants of the
					Philippine Travel Agencies Association’s (PTAA) 21 st Travel
					Tour Expo 2014—the largest trade fairs of travel agencies,
					airlines, hotels, and resorts in the country held at the SMX
					Convention Center in Pasay City from February 14 to 16.
				</p>

				<p>
					“We cannot be satisfied with what we have achieved
					so far. The goal now is not merely to maintain our
					growth, but to cement our position as one of the world’s
					vacation hot spots,” he said.
				</p>

				<p>
					P-Noy has the numbers to back his claims as the
					government was able to exceed its projection: the five-
					year target of 35.5 million domestic tourists, for instance,
					was surpassed in a matter of two years in 2011 when the
					Philippines enjoyed 37.5 million domestic tourist arrivals.
				</p>

				<p>
					Last year Rough Guides named the Philippines as one
					of the top 10 destinations in 2014. The New York Times
					also listed it as one of the 46 places to go. Closer to
					home, the Shanghai Morning Post considered it as 2013’s
					Best Tropical Island Destination; the previous year
					it was the Most Romantic Destination.
				</p>

				<p>
					All of these seem to snowball from the recent
					World Economic Forum Travel &amp; Tourism
					Competitiveness Report where the Philippines was
					cited as the most improved country in the region,
					ranking 16 th regionally and 82 nd overall, 32 nd  overall
					among 140 countries, up 12 places since last edition.

					<h6>Strength in Numbers</h6>

					<p>
						Among the country’s comparative strengths are
						its natural resources (44 th ), its price competitiveness
						(24 th ), and a very strong—and improving—
						prioritization of the Travel &amp; Tourism (T&amp;T) industry
						(this indicator ranks 15 th , as government spending
						on the sector as a percentage of gross domestic
						product [GDP] is now first in the world,
						and tourism marketing and branding
						campaigns are seen to be increasingly
						effective).
					</p>

					<p>
						“The ambitious target of increasing
						arrivals by one million will also require
						an ambitious budget,” Department of
						Tourism (DoT) Undersecretary Daniel
						Corpuz told the Philippine Daily
						Inquirer in justifying the 2013 tourism
						budget of PhP2.63 billion, a 90%
						jump from 2012’s PhP1.38 billion.
					</p>

					<p>
						Although the DoT fell short in meeting
						its 2013 target, the 4.7 million foreigners
						who visited the Philippines was a 9.56%
						increase from 2012 figures, the ABS-
						CBN news site reported last February.
					</p>

					<p>
						To date, South Korea remained the
						biggest source of tourists, rising 13%
					</p>

					<p>
						to 1.16 million in 2013. South Koreans
						accounted for 25% of the country’s
						visitor arrivals last year.
					</p>

					<p>
						Meanwhile, the number of tourists
						from the United States, which make up
						15% of the total tourist arrivals, reached 652,626 in
						2013, a 3.3% increase from the previous year.
						The DoT hopes to increase tourism arrivals yearly,
						and by 2016 it aims to have 10 million foreign visitors
						a year.
					</p>

					<h6>Encourage Investments, Build Infrastructure</h6>

					<p>
						In addition, the WEF Report wrote that the
						country has been ensuring that several aspects of its
						policy rules and regulations regime are conducive
						to the development of the T&amp;T sector. Among
						these are better protection of property rights, more
						openness toward foreign investments, and few visa
						requirements for foreign visitors (ranked 7th ).
					</p>

					<p>
						However, other areas—such as the difficulty
						of starting a business in the country, in both cost
						and length of the process (ranked 94 th and 117 th ,
						respectively)—remain a challenge.
