				<p>
					The Air Passenger Bill of Rights
					is the joint administrative
					order issued by the Philippine
					Department of Transportation
					and Communications (DOTC) and the
					Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
					for the protection of air passengers against
					unsound, deceptive, or unfair business
					policies and practices of air carriers. Here are
					some important frequently asked questions:
				</p>	

				<h6>Q: What flights are covered by the Air Passenger Bill of Rights?</h6>
				<p>
					A: All flights into, from, and within the
					Philippines by a Philippine air carrier as
					well as all flights or portions of a flight from
					the Philippines by foreign air carriers.
				</p>
				
				<h6>Q: What are the rights of the passenger before purchasing a ticket?</h6>
				<p>
					A: Passengers have a right to the full, fair,
					and clear disclosure of the service offered
					and the terms and conditions of the trip to
					be purchased, such as refund and rebooking
					policies, and procedures and responsibility
					for delayed and/or cancelled flights, and
					other important conditions.
				</p>

				<p>
					Air passengers also have the right to clear
					and non-misleading fare advertisements.
					Air carriers are required to disclose the
					major restrictions (such as rebookability
					or refundability) attached to the ticket,
					including baggage allowance policies, fuel
					surcharge, government taxes and other
					crucial information.
				</p>
				
				<h6>Q: What are the passengerâ€™s rights after purchasing the ticket?</h6>
				<p>
					A: The passenger has the right to be
					processed for check-in. This means any
					passenger within the designated check-in
					area at least one (1) hour before the
					published estimated time of departure (ETD)
					cannot be considered late

						or a no-show and
						shall not be denied check-in.
					</p>

					<h6>Q: What are persons with disability (PWDs) and senior citizens entitled to as passengers?</h6>
					<p>
						A: PWDs and senior citizens are entitled to
						have their own check-in counter. Moreover,
						air carriers are obliged to coordinate with
						the proper authorities for the use of airport
						equipment, entryways and/or aerobridges
						(if available) to facilitate the movement,
						boarding and/or disembarkation of PWDs
						and senior citizens.
					</p>

					<h6>Q: Can a passenger who has checked in be denied boarding?</h6>
					<p>
						A: Yes, but only for legal or valid causes
						such as immigration issues, safety and
						security, health concerns, non-appearance at
						the boarding gate at the appointed boarding
						time, or government requisition of space.
					</p>

					<h6>Q: Can an air carrier overbook a flight?</h6>
					<p>
						A: Yes. It is an airline practice to sell
						seats beyond the actual seating capacity
						of the aircraft. However, any expense,
						consequence, or inconvenience caused to
						affected passengers must be shouldered by
						the air carrier.
					</p>

					<h6>Q: What are the duties and obligations of an air carrier in case a flight is overbooked?</h6>
					<p>
						A: In case of overbooking, the air carrier
						shall look for volunteers willing to give
						up their seats. The air carrier shall provide
						the interested passengers or volunteers a
						list of amenities and offers, which they
						can choose from. The list of amenities
						shall always include the option to be given 
						priority booking in the next available flight
						or to be endorsed to another air carrier upon
						payment of any fare difference, and/or a
						cash incentive. The air carrier shall increase
						the compensation package until the required
						number of volunteers is met.
