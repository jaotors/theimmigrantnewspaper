					The jury is still out on whether the Philippines is
					preparing well enough for the formal establishment
					of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic
					Community (AEC), which will bring together the member economies of
					the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) into a single
					economic unit, at the end of the year.
				</p>

				<p>
					On one hand, the Philippine government, through the Department
					of Trade and Industry, has long declared that the country was well-
					positioned to compete and take advantage of the opportunities from
					an integrated regional economy, as it is one of the most liberalized states
					in ASEAN. “We are poised to compete because we have liberalized ahead
					of the others. Many of our business people and our sectors are already
					competitive and therefore any further liberalization will be to our
					advantage,” Trade Secretary Gregory L. Domingo explained.
				</p>

				<p>
					“Our economy is very strong even with those (foreign ownership)
					restrictions. Many countries including our neighbors in the north have a lot
					more restrictions than us, and they’ve shown tremendous growth. While
					these restrictions are irritants, they are not major blocks to our high growth,”
					he earlier said.
				</p>

				<p>
					On the other hand, the private sector, represented by the local
					business groups, has been calling on the government to provide more
					badly needed assistance because local firms, particularly small and
					medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are expected to reel from the onslaught
					of foreign companies and brands that are expected to set up shop in the
					Philippines.
				</p>

				<p>
					Business groups lament that the increasingly stiff competition from
					foreign brands, coupled with the country’s high power and logistics
					costs, continued port congestion, lack of SME financing, and burdensome,
					repetitive government related procedures will hamper the growth,
					if not cripple altogether, vulnerable sectors including agriculture.

						There is general agreement, however, that the AEC will indeed
						bring in new social, political and economic opportunities that should
						be tapped, as well as hurdles and challenges that the Philippines should
						overcome if it wants to leverage on the expected growth in the region.
					</p>

					<p>
						The AEC is seen to transform the 10 ASEAN member states into a
						single market and production base, to be characterized by the free flow
						of goods, services, skilled labor, investments and capital.
					</p>

					<p>
						ASEAN, with its combined population of more than 600
						million, is one of the fastest growing economic regions in the world. It has
						a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of about $2.3 trillion (as of 2012), while its total trade with the rest of the world stands at about $2.5 trillion.
						For the Philippines, this means having the potential to further increase its trade
						and investments within the region, open opportunities for many SMEs to venture out
						and expand their market reach, and, if it plays its cards right, the country can also serve as a launchpad, a hub, or a base for many foreign
						firms wanting to cement their presence in the region.
					</p>

					<p>
						There is thus an earnest and aggressive push being made by the Philippines to woo
						more foreign investors into setting up their production facilities in the country, on the
						back of an attractive incentive package offered through the various economic zones and under the Investment Priorities Plan.
					</p>

					<p>
						So far, the bulk or more than 70 percent
						of the work needed to establish the AEC has
						already been completed, government officials
						said.
					</p>

					<p>
						By virtue of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), more than 99 percent
						of goods traded in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, and Brunei have been
						at zero tariff since January 2010, while Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam
						have been offering 0-5 percent duties on 98.6 percent of goods sourced within the region.
					</p>

					<p>
						A number of critical products are still protected by tariffs within ASEAN such as
						rice, sugar, swine, and chicken.
					</p>

					<p>
						Philippine tariffs on most product lines have
						already been eliminated except for rice, duties
						for which will be cut to 35 percent from 40
						percent, and for sugar, which will be cut to 5
						percent, this year.
