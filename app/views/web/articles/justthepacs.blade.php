					Is Manny Pacquiao still relevant? Book author and boxing commentator Ted Lerner lists down the reasons

					On the sidewalk outside a
					raggedy looking carinderia
					(eatery) a few blocks from
					my house, a street seller
					daily peddles a few paintings. Each
					morning he displays his wares and, for
					the last several years, it’s always the same
					forlorn collection: a galleon ship, a naked
					lady, some historical European guy with a
					beard, and a shirtless, stern looking Manny
					Pacquiao, muscle-bound arms folded,
					staring at passing pedestrians as if to say,
					‘I’m going to bash your head in punk!’
				</p>

				<p>
					As I walked past the makeshift stall the
					other day something struck me about that
					painting of the great fighting Filipino. Like all
					of the peddler’s items, the portrait of Pacquiao
					has been sitting there for sale for over two
					years. How quickly times have changed.
					Even just three or four years ago, that painting
					would’ve surely been as hot a seller as the
					lugaw, mongo and pinakbet that gets doled out
					inside the eatery every day at lunch.
				</p>

				<p>
					And with the media circus gearing up for
					Pacquiao’s next fight, this one on November
					24 in Macau against American slugger
					Brandon Rios, I wondered; Is Manny
					Pacquiao still must-watch TV for sports fans
					around the globe? Is Manny Pacquiao still
					relevant?
				</p>

				<p>
					Before I attempt to answer that question,
					we might as well cut right to the heart of the
					matter. Yes we have to face the cold, hard
					facts. The awesome, carefree, hard-living,
					wild child fighting machine that first swept
					through the Philippines in the mid to late
					1990s, then Asia, then the US and eventually
					the entire world, is gone, never to come
					back. Sure, you might see that phenomenal
					fighting force in spurts against Rios,
					whose style is made for the hard-charging
					Pacquiao. But the entire package that
					wowed so many the world over for years?
					Forget about it.
				</p>

				<p>
					It’s been a while since we’ve seen the
					Pacquiao of legend. Four years to be exact,
					going back to his destruction of Miguel
					Cotto in November 2009. Since then it’s

						been a fairly steady decline: three fights
						where he couldn’t knock out questionable
						opponents, a fight with Juan Manuel
						Marquez where nearly everyone except
						the judges thought he lost, a lacklustre
						performance in a disputed loss to Tim
						Bradley, then getting viciously knocked
						unconscious in the 6 th round by old nemesis
						Marquez.
					</p>

					<p>
						What happened? Well, on the surface
						Pacquiao’s decline is nothing more than
						what has happened to every fighter going
						back to the beginnings of modern day
						boxing in the late 1800s. The fight game
						is a brutal way to make a living. Whether
						it be the gruelling training or the fights
						themselves, professional boxing extracts a
						tremendous toll on the physical and mental
						well-being of even the greatest fighters.
						Father time catches up with ALL boxers.
					</p>

					<p>
						One of the things that I’ve always
						loved about Pacquiao is his willingness to
						challenge the best fighters out there, and

						then go into the ring with all guns ablaze.
						Pacquiao, though, is now 34 years old
						and has been doing it like this for nearly
						20 years, which is an eternity in boxing.
					</p>

					<p>
						And don’t forget that since he moved up to
						welterweight against Oscar De La Hoya in
						2008, Pacquiao has absorbed punishment
						from guys who were sometimes 15 to 20
						pounds bigger than him come fight night.
						Even in victory, the body pays a heavy,
						long-term price.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Still, while the physical decline of
						Pacquiao has been inevitable, when this
						downward trend comes wholly as a result
						from boxing at the highest levels, it’s truly
						understandable and even admirable. But
						Pacquiao’s woes in the ring haven’t just
						come from ageing and this is where my
						interest in the Pacman has certainly flagged.
						I’m referring to Pacquiao’s entrance into
						politics.
