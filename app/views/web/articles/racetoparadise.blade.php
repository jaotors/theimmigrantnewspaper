					April Fool’s Day this year saw
					the 20th official edition of the
					San Fernando Race, a Hong
					Kong-to-Philippines yachting
					event which actually dates back to 1977,
					when a mere six boats took part in braving
					the trip across the West Philippine Sea (or
					South China Sea).
				</p>

				<p>
					It was a race eagerly anticipated by sailors
					from across the globe, who usually cast
					off from the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club
					(RHKYC) to reach La Union on the western
					Philippine shore. The sailors aimed to be
					the first to sample the natural beauty of the
					Philippines awaiting them at the finish line
					– the beautiful islands, white sand beaches,
					and turquoise blue-green seas, as well as, of
					course, the various laidback watering holes
					dotting Luzon’s west coast.
				</p>

				<p>
					But this year, Mother Nature saw fit to
					throw a wrench into the organizers’ plans.
				</p>

				<p>
					Just as T he I mmIgranT went to press, race
					chairman Gerry Daughton announced the
					rerouting of the race course as Typhoon
					Maysak barreled through Luzon on Easter
					Sunday, right onto the intended path of the
					sailors from Hong Kong to San Fernando.
				</p>

				<p>
					“Given the information and forecasts
					available to them, the Royal Hong Kong
					Yacht Club and the San Fernando Race
					Organizing Committee believe that there is
					no alternative but to alter the destination of
					this year’s race in the interests of competitor
					safety,” Daughton said. The event instead
					became a challenging 330-nautical mile
					offshore race from Hong Kong and back.

						17 of the 25 boats still competed in
						the shortened race, which is usually a
						480-nautical mile Category 1 offshore
						regatta.
					</p>

					<p>
						Competitors converged at the RHKYC from
						as far afield as New Zealand and Australia to
						set off for the supposed two-day battle. The
						race is known for the tactical challenges it tends
						to throw up and the rough seas at the start of
						the first night, as well as the network of holes
						as the fleet approaches the Luzon coast, which
						have robbed many a boat of first place.

						However, before the race route was
						changed, the sailors had been drawn to the
						promise of what awaited them at the end:
						the exquisite lush nature of the Philippines,
						the laidback resorts and beach bars which
						can be found on the San Fernando stretch
						of La Union’s coastline, and, of

						course, the opportunity to then sail around this beautiful
						country and experience more of its stunning
						scenery and warm culture.

					<p>
						This is actually part of what made the race
						so appealing to the Royal Hong Kong
						Yacht Club in the first place – because of
						the support of the Philippine Department
						of Tourism, which has always supported
						the growth of this event by facilitating
						anchorage, customs, and immigration
						facilities, the sailors are encouraged to stay
						beyond the actual event and experience the
						country and its very accessible cruising
						grounds.
					</p>

					<p>
						But there’s also a more serious, philanthropic
						side to this event, since it supports a children’s
						home through the San Fernando Foundation,
						and a dinner and charity auction before the race
