					The happiest people i know work in shorts. it’s as true in Batanes, northernmost tip of
					the philippines, as it is at the Google headquarters in northern California.			
				
					I thought of this as nards Garcia, in navy blue cargo shorts and 
					Umijang statement shirt (Umijang is the ivatan
					word for “let us help each other”) was proudly showing us the centuries-old 
					coral-and-stone houses in the seaside town of
					savidug in Batanes’ sabtang island.
				</p>

					“I want to educate the people here on the value of what we do.
					I want to show them that everyone can stand to benefit from what
					we are doing,” our cheerful ivatan guide said as we approached a
					limestone quarry by the shore.
					in a province where 90 percent of jobs are provided by the
					government, tourism can create opportunities where there was
					none before. to date, more than 60,000 Batanes residents have left
					to find work elsewhere in the Philippines or abroad.
				</p>

				<p>
					Batanes Governor Vicente Gato recognizes the situation, and
					the value of travel and tourism to his province. he has been
					meeting with UNESCO officials in an effort to protect and classify
					the province’s remaining heritage sites.
					he hopes Batanes can get a piece of the pie from the 400,000
					tourists who visit the philippines every month.
					the world economic Forum (WEF) considers travel and
					tourism as one of the leading job creators in the world, employing
					98 million people directly. this represents three percent of the
					world’s total employment.

					“When indirect and induced impact is included, the industry
					contributes to around one in eleven jobs worldwide,” 2013 travel
					&amp; tourism Competitiveness report from the WEF said.
					In the fickle international travel circuit where everyone is looking
					for the next Big thing, the philippines is batting to be the it-place.
					in 2012, there were 4.3 million tourist arrivals in the country,
					“the highest number ever” according to philippine tourism
					Secretary Ramon Jimenez, Jr. The Philippines, he said, is on track
					to hit its goal of 10 million visitors for 2016.

						The WEF report ranked the Philippines 82nd out 140 countries
						in its travel and tourism Competitiveness index, up by 12 places
						from last year. the philippines is the most improved country in
						the region, ranking 16th regionally and 82nd overall. Among the
						country’s comparative strengths are its natural resources (44th), its
						price competitiveness (24th), and a very strong—and improving—
						prioritization of the travel and tourism industry.
					</p>

					<p>
						The WEF further noted that the philippine government’s
						spending on the travel and tourism sector as a percentage of its
						gross domestic product is now first in the world. It added that the
						country’s tourism marketing and branding campaigns are seen to
						be “increasingly effective.”
					</p>

					<p>
						With little fanfare, the Department of tourism (Dot) launched in 2012 what could be its
						most successful campaign yet— It’s More Fun in the Philippines.
						tourism secretary Jimenez, a 35-year veteran of the advertising
						industry, credited this campaign for the increased tourist arrivals
						last year.
					</p>

					<p>
						The campaign addresses the question often posed by foreigners
						“Why should i go to your country?” with a typical Filipino
						answer: “it’s more fun where i come from.”
						Since Dot has a mere US$2 million for promotions,
						compared to the US$S40 million spent by Malaysia, the department
						turned to a previously untapped, relatively free and very dynamic
						resource—the Filipino online community. In a 2010 international
						telecommunication Union study, the United nations specialized agency
						for information and communication technologies discovered that an estimated 29.7
						million Filipinos, almost 30 percent of the population, were connected to the internet.
					</p>

					<p>
						“There is a tremendous amount of interest. i’ll tell you why.
						we have gone into the social media not just with the country
						brand—we have gone into the social media with the lifestyle
						people have been looking for all their lives,” Jimenez said
						in a recent interview aired on a government television.
