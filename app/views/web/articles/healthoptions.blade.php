					Are you absolutely sure you want to be
					discharged?” the doctor at The Medical City
					asked.
				</p>

				<p>
					Carmelita, 72, with a broken hipbone,
					nodded and signed the waiver. She was in
					such pain that she could barely stand, but there was no way
					she could pay PhP300,000-400,000, as the doctor quoted, for a
					surgery that normally lasts less than two hours.
					Carmelita is not rich, but she certainly isn’t within the 28
					percentile of the Philippine population that lives in poverty.
					Yet a partial hip replacement surgery at The Medical City
					would cost this middle-income retiree her entire savings.
				</p>

				<p>
					A week later, at a small hospital tucked in a residential
					neighborhood in Quezon City, Carmelita was recovering in
					a PhP4,000/night room, her hip fixed by a well-respected
					orthopedic surgeon who also holds clinic at The Medical City.
					Her total bill: PhP220,000.
					“The Philippines does not have a law standardizing charges,
					so it’s all based on the client’s ability to pay,” Roland Cortez,
					Assistant Secretary at the Philippine Department of Health
					(DOH) said, explaining the differing rates for the same
					services in hospitals.
				</p>

				<p>
					“There’s a problem with health professionals,” he said. “If I
					am seeing you at, say, St. Luke’s Medical Center, I will charge
					you higher. If you go to St. Luke’s, the doctors will always
					think that you have money.”
				</p>

				<h6>Show Me the Money</h6>

				<p>
					In fact, even at St. Luke’s, the rates vary: in 2010, the
					neurologist of this writer’s father charged PhP500 for
					consultation at St. Luke’s Quezon City, and PhP800 at St.
					Luke’s Global City, a swanky, hotel-type hospital where
					patients check in as guests.
					Like any other business, healthcare in the Philippines is
					market-driven, and paying clients who require complete
					comfort and attention are a well-serviced sector, among them
					expatriates.
				</p>

				<p>
					Wary of government hospitals, which are often understaffed
					and suffers bad service perceptions, most of the estimated
					180,000 foreigners living in the Philippines make a beeline for
					premier facilities to seek medical care.

						Australian Dan Owens, who moved to the Philippines
						with his young family in 2011, said healthcare was a big
						concern for them. His nine-year-old son had asthma, and his
						job entailed overseeing operations in nine locations across
						the country, so he needed an insurer that would cover any
						accidents when traveling.
					</p>

					<p>
						Owens booked World Nomads, a global provider that offers
						customizable travel and healthcare packages that would cover
						even flights back to Australia for serious health issues.
						Thankfully, Owens’s family has not had any medical
						emergencies, although for routine check ups they have seen
						orthodontists and specialists who were recommended by friends.
					</p>

					<p>
						“They have all been excellent. If (we) did not have
						the money or insurance, I would be scared by what the
						public system could offer,” Owens said.

						This dismal but well-founded lack of confidence in the
						public health system is what the Philippine government
						has been trying to change for three years now.
						Since 2011, there has been a steady and substantial
						increase in funding for health, in line with President
						Aquino’s instruction to pursue a program called
						Kalusugang Pangkalahatan (Universal Health Care).
					</p>

					<p>
						From PhP24.6 billion in 2010, the DOH’s budget rose
						to PhP 31.8 billion in 2011, PhP42.1 billion in 2012 and
						PhP51 billion in 2013. For 2014, the DOH is poised to
						get around PhP80 billion, the fifth biggest chunk of the
						proposed PhP2.2 trillion national budget.
					</p>

					<p>
						A large portion of the revenues from the newly
						passed Sin Tax Law, which increases the excise taxes
						of alcohol and tobacco products, will also go to health
						expenditures. This translates to an additional PhP35-
						40 billion for health care in the first year of the law’s
						implementation.
					</p>

					<p>
						A significant part of this fat budget has been
						earmarked for the improvement of government health
						facilities.
