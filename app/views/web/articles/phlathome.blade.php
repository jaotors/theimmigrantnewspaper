					Keith Watkins and Bob Gindernally sat outside the
					corner store in Cainta, Rizal, north of Metro Manila,
					enjoying each other’s company and the rare appearance of the
					elusive September sun.
				</p>

				<p>
					Watkins, 49, has been living in the Philippines the past four years with his
					Filipina wife. He lost this job in England and so they decided to pack up for the Philippines
					where the cost of living is decidedly cheaper. In the meantime Gindernally, 62, has
					shuttled regularly to and fro Asia and Hawaii that it has become more practical for him
					to relocate in the region. His wife for three decades is a Filipina so moving to the
					Philippines seemed to him like the natural decision to make.
				</p>

				<p>
					Watkins and Gindernally are just two
					of thousands who chose to relocate to the
					Philippines over the past years as part of the
					phenomenon of International Retirement
					Migration (IRM) driven primarily by ageing
					baby boomers.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This demographic is generally classified
					as the “active retired” who prefer to integrate
					into the host community, need special care,
					or want to live in a more structured and gated
					community of similar individuals.
					The Philippine Retirement Agency (PRA)
					reports that gross enrolment for the Special
					Resident Retirees Visa (SRRV) in 2012
					alone is 3,426, a 42 percent jump from the
					previous year’s 2,580. Last year also marked
					a milestone when enrollment breached the
					3,000 mark for the first time in 27 years.
				</p>

				<p>
					Cumulative gross enrollment for SRRV
					is at 28,893 while cumulative enrollment is
					20,818, landmark levels according to PRA.

						Established in 1985 the PRA is mandated
						to attract foreign nationals and former
						Filipino citizens to invest, reside and retire
						in the Philippines with the end-view of
						accelerating the socio-economic development
						of the country and contributing to the foreign
						currency reserve of the economy all the
						while providing them the best quality of life
						in the most attractive package. Since 2009,
						PRA has operated under the Department of
						Tourism (DOT).
					</p>
					
					<h6>Rising Numbers</h6>

					<p>
						According to a 2011 thesis paper by
						Mervin Magbuhat for the Graduate School
						of International Affairs of the Ming Chuan
						University, as many as 160,000 migrants
						from neighboring countries and some returned
						migrants from the United States have actually
						resettled in the Philippines.
					</p>

					<p>
						Most expatriates carry resident or
						immigrant visas; Watkins and Gindernally,
						meanwhile, have non-quota immigrant visas
						by virtue of being married to Philippine
						nationals.

						Since 2010 the Philippines has made
						it consistently in the International Living
						magazine’s top 20 best retirement destinations
						in the world. This year it also lands in the 15 th
						spot in the Cost of Living category with a
						perfect score of 100.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<em>Live and Invest Overseas</em> publisher
						Kathleen Peddicord also lists the Philippines
						as among the world’s cheapest places to retire
						on a budget of USD1,200 a month or less.
					</p>

					<p>
						Citing Cebu as a particular example where it is not
						as “too hot and too crowded” like the capital Metro
						Manila, Peddicord says the country’s biggest draw is
						the cost of living and of real estate.
					</p>

					<p>
						“Expats in Cebu come from all over the world, but
						the majority are from the United States, England, and
						Australia, plus a few from Germany, including good
						numbers of men aged 45 to their mid-60s who’ve
						come so their pensions will stretch much further than
						they would back home and, often, to restart their lives
						with new wives and new families,” she writes.
