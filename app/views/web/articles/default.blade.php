				<h3>Inclusive economics</h3>

					The APEC meetings, which the Philippines is hosting this year, aim to build 
					inclusive market economies that reach the people at the bottom of the pyramid.

					The Philippines has witnessed strong economic
					growth in recent years, growing 6.1 percent
					annually from 2012 to 2014, and averaging
					5 percent growth since 2002. Leveraging strong
					macroeconomic fundamentals and sound fiscal
					management, the country has earned multiple credit upgrades
					from major ratings agencies: Standard &amp; Poor’s, Moody’s, and
					Fitch. Furthermore, strong growth in manufacturing combined
					with a robust services sector growth has propelled the
					Philippines to be among the most dynamic emerging markets in
					the Asia-Pacific region.
				</p>

				<p>
					Nevertheless, it seems the main benefits of economic growth
					have failed to trickle down to those in the lower socioeconomic
					strata. Poverty reduction has been very weak, compounded
					by largely unequal income distribution across and within
					Philippine regions. In the latest poverty estimates by the
					National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA),
					rising incomes among the poor have been wiped out by rising
					prices of basic commodities, notably the main food staple, rice.
					Poverty also increased in early 2014, reaching 25.8 percent
					from an estimated 24.6 percent the year
					before.
				</p>

				<p>
					Hence, even as the Philippines
					is climbing the global economic
					competitiveness rankings and garnering
					multiple upgrades in credit ratings, it will
					also fail to achieve the first United Nations
					Millennium Development Goal of reducing
					its poverty incidence by half compared
					with its incidence in 2000.
				</p>

				<p>
					This challenge of translating broader
					economic growth to “growth for all” is one
					shared by countries in the broader Asia-Pacific. Analysts point

						to the tension between high growth and rising inequality in the
						region. The regional average annual GDP growth rate registered
						7 percent from 1990 to 2010, more than twice that of Latin
						America and the Caribbean (See Figure 1). About 700 million
						individuals in developing Asia have been lifted out of poverty
						as a result of this growth.
					</p>

					<p>
						Inequality nevertheless persisted and rose in some
						countries between the 1990s and the 2000s. Of the 28
						economies with comparable data in the region, 12 –
						constituting more than 80 percent of the population of
						developing Asia in 2010 – saw a rise in their Gini coefficient
						of per capita expenditure (See Figure 2). 13 of 36 economies
						with available data registered a Gini coefficient at or greater
						than 40, widely used as the threshold for “high inequality.”
						<em>(The Gini index is a measurement of the income distribution
						of a country’s residents. This number, which ranges between
						0 to 1 and is based on residents’ net income, helps define the
						gap between the rich and the poor, with 0 representing perfect
						equality and 1 representing perfect inequality. –Ed.)</em>

						Among Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
						member states, three countries reached or surpassed this high
						inequality threshold in the 2000s, namely Malaysia, Philippines,
						and Thailand (See Table 1). The ASEAN average Gini coefficient
						was moreover very close to the threshold at 39.8. Across
						developing Asia, average per capita expenditure of the top 20
						percent was seven times greater than that of the bottom 20 percent.

						<strong>Inclusive markets require strong
						public investments</strong>

					<p>
						It is in this context that Philippines set the agenda for Asia-
						Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 2015 as “Building
						Inclusive Economies, Building a Better World.”
