					This year, the United States is excited that the Philippines,
					our long-time friend and ally, is hosting the Asia-Pacific
					Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum. Over the past 25
					years, APEC has strengthened diplomatic ties through its
					top priorities such as advancing economic integration,
					developing human capital, promoting women’s empowerment, and
					combating climate change.
				</p>

				<p>
					With 21 member economies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, APEC
					brings the region together. The Philippines is using its status as host of
					APEC in 2015 to promote the theme of inclusive growth, with specific
					initiatives to advance regional economic integration, increase access to
					capital and markets for small and medium enterprises, and build sustainable
					and resilient communities to face natural and manmade disasters.
				</p>

				<p>
					The United States (and other APEC economies) supports the Philippine
					proposal to develop an “APEC Services Framework” aimed at expanding
					cross-border trade and investment in services, as well as the continuation
					of work on urbanization and the Internet economy, which were put forward
					during China’s host year in 2014.
				</p>

				<p>
					The United States has itself put forward initiatives to advance diplomacy,
					such as promoting economic growth, protecting the environment, and
					supporting disaster resiliency. We also continue work on other APEC top
					priorities including combating corruption, promoting women’s economic

					empowerment, facilitating cross-border education, promoting food security,
					and creating an enabling environment for infrastructure investment.

					One example of US-Philippine cooperation in support of APEC goals
					is the Alliance for Artisan Enterprise (AAE), a collaboration between the
					Philippines, the Aspen Institute, and the Secretary of State’s Office of Global
					Women’s Issues (S/GWI). Launched in November 2012, it promotes artisan
					enterprises globally with a specific focus on women artisans and their families.
					Within the Philippines, the project seeks to increase micro-enterprise access to
					capital to allow them to become part of the global value chain and to provide
					income to the communities in which these businesses operate.
				</p>

				<p>
					Another example of how we are tackling global problems together
					through APEC is in climate change and energy.

					The Philippines has agreed to
					undertake a fossil fuel subsidy peer review under APEC. This review, which
					the United States is supporting with financial and technical assistance, will
					study how subsidies and other policies can lead to increased use of fossil
					fuels and higher greenhouse gas emissions. The Philippines has largely
					eliminated such subsidies and can share its experience with other APEC
					economies as they seek to reduce their emissions and make renewable fuels
					more competitive in the marketplace. This will lead to a cleaner environment
					for all of us.
				</p>

				<p>
					As APEC enters its 26th year, it continues to be an example of countries
					coming together for common causes, which is what diplomacy is all about.
