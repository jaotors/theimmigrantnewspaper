					From vicious to virtuous cycles
					“If, given a generous frame of 50 years,” writes
					Professor Felipe Miranda of the University of the
					Philippines for a United Nations report, “a regime
					fails to initiate and make viable the processes and institutions
					that modern democracies must develop to endure, if most
					of its citizens are unable to live human lives, then there is a
					good chance that it is not democratic or truly interested in
					democratizing.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Professor Miranda’s assertion is based on Schmitter and
					Karl’s definition: “Modern political democracy is a system
					of governance in which rulers are held accountable for
					their actions in the public realm by citizens, acting directly
					through the competition and cooperation of their elected
					representatives.”
				</p>
				
				<p>
					As a take-off point for assessing the state of Philippine
					democracy, he comes up with a working definition:
					“As a system of governance, it demonstrably promotes—
					however slowly or gradually, even allowing for occasional,
					temporary reverses—a progressively human quality of life for
					its citizens within 50 years of a regime’s formal democratic
					institution.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Professor Miranda goes further to say that “seeking
					democratization in the Philippines in the past 50 years is like
					chasing the wind.”<br/>
					This was the challenge that faced Benigno S. Aquino III
					two years ago: to establish a new culture and infrastructure
					of governance anchored upon public accountability that will
					improve the people’s quality of life
				</p>

				<p>
					President Aquino was catapulted into the presidency in what
					a leading columnist described as “(a manifestation of) Edsa
					People Power masquerading as an election.” While he won by
					a huge margin of more than five million votes over his nearest
					opponent (deposed President Joseph Ejercito Estrada), his share
					of the electoral vote was only a plurality of 42 per cent over a
					field of nine other candidates.
				</p>

				<p>
					Today, President Aquino enjoys the highest popularity and
					trust ratings in the post-EDSA era. According to the latest Pulse
					Asia survey, his performance approval and trust ratings are at
					78 and 80 per cent, respectively.

					<p>
						Considering that the income distribution profile of Filipinos
						is heavily skewed toward the poor and marginalized, such high
						ratings could only be attained because the President continues
						to enjoy broad support among the “the last, the least, and the
						lost”. Sixty-seven per cent of all Filipinos belong to Class D
						while 23 per cent are in Class E. Those in the latter category
						are the target beneficiaries of the Conditional Cash Transfer
						(CCT) program that aims to deliver an integrated social welfare
						and development package to the poorest 4.6 million families.
					</p>

					<p>
						The CCT program represents a paradigm shift, a radical
						departure from previous poverty alleviation approaches that
						followed the traditional trickle-down theory of development. Evidently,
						previous gains in economic output in the country have favored the elite few
						over the vast majority of impoverished Filipinos.
					</p>

					<p>
						While purposively addressing the centuries-old poverty blight, President
						Aquino has inaugurated a new culture of governance that reverses the flow
						of authority. ‘Kayo ang boss ko’ (‘You are my bosses’), was his clarion
						declaration as he took his oath of office.
					</p>

					<p>
						He also exemplifies humility and commitment to the rule of law
						by insisting that even his presidential convoy should follow traffic signals.
					</p>

					<p>
						“Good governance translates into good economics,” observes Finance
						Secretary Cesar Purisima, chairman of the cabinet’s economic cluster that
						is credited with creating the fiscal space that has engendered steady
						economic growth.
					</p>

					<p>
						Citing “prudent economic policies coupled with political stability (that)
						will aid in its faster expansion,” Citigroup projects that the country’s
						gross domestic product (GDP) will grow to 6.3 percent in 2012; and that,
						despite continuing economic woes in Europe and North America, the
						economy’s 2013 growth rate will be nearly the same at 6.1 percent.
					</p>

					<p>
						Meanwhile, the Philippines is steadily progressing toward a
						near-investment grade rating from all the major rating agencies. This
						has enabled the country to reduce its outlay for debt repayment
						significantly.
