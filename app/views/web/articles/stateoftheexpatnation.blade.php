					Southeast Asian countries’ economic integration looms, yet the Philippines,

					What's 177,368 EXPATRIATES IN a country of 95 million? That’s the count according to the 
					2010 Census of the Philippine Population by the National Statistics Office.* Compare that number 
					to expat populations of nearby East or Southeast Asian countries. Still too few.
				</p>
				<p>
					What the statistics show is that foreigners and even the greater Filipino public still 
					do not see the Philippines as a destination country for better-paying employment or 
					permanent residency. The more prominent demographic phenomenon is the 11 million Overseas 
					Filipino Workers (OFWs) found elsewhere eking out a living in 220 countries across the globe.<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					However, recent waves of demographic and economic developments are beginning to necessitate for 
					this middleincome country to better manage foreigners’ influx, a challenge which shouldn’t 
					be new to a country that has figured in the history of human mobility in the past centuries.<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					The reality is that the foreigners who are here can either be a boon or a bane, and efforts by 
					the Philippinesto handle them result in intentions of warm hospitality sadly falling at 
					the wayside as scattered (not integrated) initiatives by wellmeaning agencies become the 
					normative experience up front.<br/>
				</p>
					<h6>Spreading Out</h6>
				<p>
					The modern-day influx of foreigners to the Philippines manifest in varied and unusual circumstances: 
					in Collegiate and professional basketball teams, in Philippine operations of business process 
					outsourcing companies, at Korean stores in bustling cities like Makati, on the beaches of Panglao Island 
					in Bohol.
				</p>
				<p>
					Out of the 177,368 foreigners Americans (29,972), Chinese (28,705), Japanese (11,584), Indians, South 
					Koreans, North Koreans, Canadians, British, Australians, and Indonesians lead the pack. Findings of the 
					2010 Census indicate that three out of 10 foreigners while the rest are scattered across Central Luzon, 
					Calabarzon, and Central Visayas.Many of these foreigners come from countries with which the Philippines 
					have strong economic relations.

						Koreans, for instance, find their way here given the influx of students 
						seeking secondary and tertiary education.
					</p>

					<p>
						According to the World Tourism Organization, Malaysia leads the region with 24.7 million tourist 
						arrivals, followed by Thailand with 19.1 million, Singapore 10.3 million, Indonesia 75.6 million, 
						Vietnam 6.01 million, and the Philippines with 3.917 million.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Foreigners are bound by the rules of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, which led to the 
						birth of the Bureau of Immigration (BI). Like Filipinos working abroad, foreigners here are 
						bound by local regulations—including public order and safety, as well as foreigners’ annual 
						mandatory reporting to the BI.
					</p>
					<p class="callout">
						Low foreign direct investments, prevailing stringent costs of doing business, and feeble manufacturing 
						and agricultural sectors in the Philippines still flag urgent concerns 
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, foreigners wishing to work in the Philippines have to seek alien employment permits with 
						the Philippines’ Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).
					</p>
					<p>
						And should they wish to retire in the Philippines, the Philippine Retirement Authority (PRA) offers 
						various sorts of visas. And unlike other countries where the immigration offices handle citizenship 
						applications, a foreigner will be naturalized through a law passed by Congress which created a Special 
						Committee on Naturalization
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="columns large-6 medium-6 typography">
					<p>
						with the power to approve, deny or reject applications.
					</p>

					<h6>Setting Sights</h6>
				
					<p>
						In 2012 BI deported around 603 foreigners including 379 Taiwanese and 124 Chinese nationals 
						nabbed for cybercrimes. In the same period BI filed cases against 584 aliens for violating 
						the country’s immigration laws. The previous year in 2011, BI disallowed 980 aliens from 
						entering the country due to suspicions by immigration officials that they’re “undesirable.”
					</p>
					<p>
						On a positive note, the Philippine Retirement Authority reports that some 27,000 foreign retirees 
						from 107 countries have chosen the Philippinesto be their home. They were thus given PRA’s special 
						resident retirees’ visas (SRRVs), allowing them to live in the Philippinesfor as long as they want.
					</p>
					<p>
						The most visible economic gain for the Philippines given the potential of a foreign population is 
						investments. The most evident constraint is that the Philippine Constitution disallows investments 
						that are majority owned by period after foreigners (Although amid a clamor to amend that particular 
						provision in the 1987 Constitution, the national government has released a list of businesses and 
						industries and the allowable percent of foreigners’ equity for them.)
