					What is a citizen?
					What constitutes citizenship?
					These are questions hardly
					asked in this day and age of
					blurred lines and definitions tossed and twisted to suit
					a particular kind of political correctness. Inasmuch as
					words find solid footing in the meanings given them, the
					words ‘citizen’ and ‘citizenship’ achieve better traction
					only by way of one’s understanding of allegiance. Every
					other detail attached to it—no doubt significant to the
					overall provision—falls by the wayside. Citizenship
					is a matter of the heart and exercise of will more than
					birth or a set of rights, where anything less than full and
					undeniable involvement in the decisions made by the State
					can be considered an assault on one’s sovereignty, and
					thus on the sovereign State to which one belongs. It is, in
					the final analysis, one’s blueprint to a collective identity.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this light, talk of dual citizenship naturally
					raises questions as to its real intent. Based on a 1993
					law—Republic Act 9225—Filipinos who went through
					naturalization in other countries can reacquire Philippine
					citizenship as long as the new host country legally allows
					it. The advantages are plentiful and no less tempting:
					privilege to vote in the national elections; own real
					property and operate a business sans the commonplace
					restrictions; the practice of one’s profession in the
					Philippines; even for spouse and members of family to
					avoid exit clearances and fees during travel.
				</p>

				<h6>The Best of Both Worlds</h6>

				<p>
					At first glance, it seems that having the best of both
					worlds offers more payback than one would expect.
					Voting privileges come within the range of what novelist
					José Saramago once said, “As citizens, we all have an
					obligation to intervene and become involved—it’s the
					citizen who changes things.” Such involvement is crucial
					not only to the country of origin but to much sought-
					after efforts at reform, especially if some members of
					the immediate family of the dual-citizen preferred to
					stay in the Philippines. Fundamental to any citizen,
					whether single or dual, is the question of security, and
					dual citizenship seems to offer more advantages than
					disadvantages along this line.

						Along the area of business and land ownership, this
						is where it gets better. Present laws restrict ownership
						of land to foreigners. All they are allowed to do is lease
						it. Albeit there are provisions consenting to owning
						the house built on the leased land, experts say many
						foreigners rarely bite the carrot. Real property in the
						country is reserved singly for Filipino citizens. Dual
						citizenship leapfrogs over these restrictions and permits,
						without due limits, ownership of real property. This
						provides incentives for dual citizens to come home
						and retire in their country of birth.
						The same is true with the offer to own and
						operate a business. Dual citizens are exempt from
						the usual hassle of raising $200,000 as initial
						minimum investment and own only 40 percent
						interest, which foreigners are limited to enjoying.
						The same demands do not apply to dual citizens.
						In fact, RA 9225 agrees to a foreigner owning a
						business only if his dual citizen wife takes the
						remaining 60 percent of the shares.

					<h6>GREAT EXPECTATIONS, GREAT DISAPPOINTMENTS</h6>

						enough the law on
						dual citizenship hardly got out of its self-imposed
						conundrum even at the point of enactment. It has at
						the start provoked a string of reactions ranging from
						issues dealing with military service and taxation to
						the more heady frontiers of loyalty and allegiance.
						The problems it raises are hardly trifling, which
						seem to some constitutionalists as a railroading
						of Article IV Section 5 of the 1987 Philippine
						Constitution, which says, “dual allegiance of
						citizens is inimical to the national interest and shall
						be dealt with by law.”
					</p>

					<p>
						That taxation is based primarily on where
						an individual lives and not necessarily on one’s
						citizenship renders the issue null and void. Double
						taxation is a feared myth, one created and recreated as
						an argument against dual citizenship. The Philippines
						has bilateral treaties in this regard, rendering Filipinos
						living and working in foreign lands blameless for
						not paying taxes in their country of origin. Even in
						countries where bilateral treaties of this nature do not
						exist, the myth will hardly hold water.
