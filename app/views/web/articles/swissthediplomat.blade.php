				<h3>Swiss-Philippine Relations</h3>

					At first glance, Switzerland and the Philippines could hardly
					be more different: one, a landlocked mountainous country
					with barely eight million inhabitants with advanced economy;
					the other, an archipelago half way around the world with a
					development status and more than a hundred million people living in 7,107
					islands. However, a closer look bears many similarities.
				</p>

				<p>
					Relationships between the two countries date back more than one and a
					half centuries ago. Few years after the creation of modern Switzerland, the
					Swiss government decided to establish its first consulate in the Asia-Pacific
					region in Manila in 1862
				</p>

				<p>
					While adventurers were the early Swiss migrants to the Philippines,
					many travellers, farmers and businessmen soon followed. Today, names like
					Zuellig or Menzi remind us of the Swiss’ entrepreneurship spirit and their
					willingness to contribute to the economy of their new homes during the 19 th
					century and thereafter
				</p>

				<p>
					With more than 5,000 Swiss, the Philippines hosts the third largest
					Swiss expat community in Asia. Mirroring this excellent rapport is the
					15,000 Filipinos and more living in Switzerland today. And just like the
					phenomenon that is Philippine diaspora, more than 10% of the Swiss
					population also choose to live abroad, and a good number of them have
					chosen the Philippines as their second home.

					Not surprisingly these longstanding and robust interactions have
					developed into meaningful and productive business relations. Bilateral trade
					adds up to more than half a billion US dollars annually, thanks to Swiss
					investments in the Philippines that have become household names as Nestlé,
					Holcim, Zuellig, SGS, Novartis or Pasar. These companies have created
					more than 15,000 jobs for the Filipinos.

				<p>
					It is therefore only commonsensical that the Swiss and Philippine
					governments have forge agreements that covered areas such as investment
					protection, double-taxation, legal assistance or the exchange of professional
					interns. Just a few months ago, Bern and Manila agreed to establish a mixed
					economic commission, with the two sides ardently exploring the conclusion
					of a free trade agreement.

					The typhoon Yolanda which devastated large parts of the Visayas region
					last November underscored another dimension of Swiss-Philippine relations,
					namely compassion. The government immediately dispatch its Swiss
					Humanitarian Aid Unit to the Philippines and provided quick relief to the
					tune of Swiss Francs 6 million (PhP300 million). In addition—not counting
					the extensive support pledged by Swiss companies—an ongoing national
					fund-raising drive by mid-December 2013 mobilized in excess of Swiss
					Francs 37.2 million (PhP1.85 billion) for the victims of typhoon Yolanda.
					Even Swiss President Ueli Maurer took a break from his busy schedule,
					sat down and operated the telephone switchboard himself to accept phone
					pledges for the Philippines.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even in times of hardship, Swiss-Philippine relations stand the test. Both
					are well structured to grow even stronger.
